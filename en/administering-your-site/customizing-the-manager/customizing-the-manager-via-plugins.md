## System Events

In other content management systems (e.g. WordPress), usually the only way to customize the look and feel or behavior of the manager is via plugins that tie into various [System Events](developing-in-modx/basic-development/plugins/system-events "System Events"). MODX offers several other ways of achieving customizations: you can change configuration of the manager forms via [Form Customization](/display/revolution20/Form+Customization "Form Customization"), or you can change the [Manager Templates and Themes](administering-your-site/customizing-the-manager/manager-templates-and-themes "Manager Templates and Themes").
