## What is a Form Customization Profile?

A Profile is a collection of [Form Customization Sets](administering-your-site/customizing-the-manager/form-customization-sets "Form Customization Sets"). A Profile can be restricted to only load for specific User Groups. If no User Groups are assigned, the Profile will be run for all Users.

It can also be marked 'inactive', which will disable its execution.
