## use\_alias\_path

**Name**: Use Friendly Alias Path 
**Type**: Yes/No 
**Default**: No

Setting this option to 'yes' will display the full path to the document if the document has an alias.

For example, if a document with an alias called 'child' is located inside a container document with an alias called 'parent', then the full alias path to the document will be displayed as '/parent/child.html'.
