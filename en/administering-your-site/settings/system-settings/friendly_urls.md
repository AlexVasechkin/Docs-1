**Name**: Use Friendly URLs   
**Type**: Yes/No   
**Default**: No

This allows you to use search engine friendly URLs with MODx. Please note, this only works for MODx installations running on Apache, and you'll need to write a .htaccess file for this to work. See the .htaccess file included in the distribution for more info.
