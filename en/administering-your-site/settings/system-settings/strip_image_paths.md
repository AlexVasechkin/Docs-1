strip\_image\_paths
-------------------

**Name**: Rewrite Browser Paths   
**Type**: Yes/No   
**Default**: Yes

If this is set to 'No', MODx will write file browser resource src's (images, files, flash, etc.) as absolute URLs. Relative URLs are helpful should you wish to move your MODx install, e.g., from a staging site to a production site. If you have no idea what this means, it's best just to leave it set to 'Yes'.

<div class="warning">This setting is **deprecated** in MODx Revolution and is no longer in use.</div>
