MODx is written in PHP, and as such, it relies on the underlying PHP date functions, e.g. [strftime](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php). The discussion here can get quite tricky because the [strftime](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php) and [strtotime](http://co.php.net/strtotime) functions deploy _similar_ arguments, but they are not identical. Sorry for the confusion; date manipulation and formatting is more complex than it might at first seem.

The discussion here relates primarily to the following content fields:

- createdon
- deletedon
- editedon
- publishedon
- unpub\_date

## Common Examples.

It's not possible to give every possible example because date formatting can be complex, and it varies from region to region. Here are a few common examples that demonstrate how to use the output filters below.

| Example Output | The Filter Parameters |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| Thu Apr 14, 2011 | `[[*createdon:strtotime:date=`%a %b %e, %Y`]]` |
| 18 April 2011 | `[[*createdon:strtotime:date=`%e %B %Y`]]` |
| Monday, April 18, 2011 | `[[*createdon:strtotime:date=`%A, %B %e, %Y`]]` |
| 2011-04-18 | `[[*createdon:strtotime:date=`%Y-%m-%d`]]` |

FYI for those running on Windows from the PHP site:

Additionally, not all platforms support negative timestamps, so your date range may be limited to no earlier than the Unix epoch. This means that %e, %T, %R and, %D (and possibly others) - as well as dates prior to _Jan 1, 1970_ - will not work on Windows, some Linux distributions, and a few other operating systems. For Windows systems, a complete overview of supported conversion specifiers can be found at [Â» MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fe06s4ak.aspx).

So the first 3 common examples given do not work on Windows!
