# Integrating a Template into MODX Tutorial

Benjamin Marte ([@benmarte](http://twitter.com/benmarte)) is writing a fantastic tutorial on how to integrate a template into MODX. His tutorial is a great starting point for beginners looking to integrate their first HTML template into MODX. This page will serve as a stub for each of the sections.

## Part 1: Project Setup, HTML Cutting, and Extras

The first part of the tutorial discusses how we will cut up the template, what extras we will use for the project, how to set the project up, and how to get the HTML, CSS, and JS paths correct.

## Part 2: Categories, Extras, Templates, Chunks, Wayfinder

The second part of the tutorial deals with generating categories to keep us organized, installing extras, applying templates to resources, creating chunks, uploading assets, and creating a navigation menu using the Wayfinder extra. Ben says "There's a lot to cover, so let's get started".

## Part 4: Template Variables (TVs) and You

Unlike the TVs to which you may historically be accustomed, these TVs are great for you. This part of the tutorial deals with how to apply and use template variables.

## Part 5: Making things User Friendly for End Users using Form Customization

There's a lot of extra fields that you may not want to explain to clients -- I'm looking at you, Content Disposition. Using Form Customization, you can hide page elements you don't want your clients to see. It's pretty great.
