## What is RefreshCache?

RefreshCache is a snippet for MODX Revolution that refreshes all cacheable resources and the chunks and snippets they contain -- whether they need it or not. It is slow and inelegant, but when it's finished, site visitors will not have to wait so long for pages to load.

It requests every resource on the site with cURL. It is intentionally slow to avoid overtaxing the server and/or running afoul of bot-blocking scripts.
