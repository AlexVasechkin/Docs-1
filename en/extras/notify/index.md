## What is Notify?

Notify sends email updates to users on your site and (optionally) posts to Twitter and Facebook. The users can be selected by User Group, and/or by tags specifying user interests. The updates are manual, rather than automatic, so Notify only sends them when you tell it to. The [Subscribe extra](https://bobsguides.com/subscribe-tutorial.html) works with Notify to let users manage their preferences and group memberships.

By default, Notify automatically sends a link to the page you were editing when you launched it, but it can also be used for free-form email messages to selected users, or all users.

Notify pre-fills an update form based on Tpl chunks you can modify. During the pre-fill process, Notify will (optionally) shorten any URLs using any one of a number of URL-shortening services. For services like Google, bit.ly, StumbleUpon, and TinyURL, Notify will use your API key during the shortening process.
