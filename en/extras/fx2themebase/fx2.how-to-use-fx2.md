## How to Use FX2 - Overview

 FX2 was designed for 2 different types of users. MODX developers and theme authors can use it as a "foundation" (see what I did there?) for building MODX site packages that end users can customize easily. End users _could_ use FX2 to power their site, as a "free" theme, but very little attention has been paid to the design and styling. The FX2 templates use Zurb's sample HTML templates, largely unmodified, except for the dynamic MODX magical bits.

Regardless, there is documentation available for both types of users. Enjoy!
