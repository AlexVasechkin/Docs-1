## What is LexiconHelper?

LexiconHelper is a utility to assist add-on component developers in internationalizing their components.

It compares code files against language files and reports missing, empty, or unused language strings. The display of missing language strings can be pasted into the language file for completion.

Although LexiconHelper can be used by itself, a much enhanced version is now part of the [MyComponents Extra Development System](https://bobsguides.com/mycomponent-tutorial.html). This standalone version of LexiconHelper is no longer developed or supported.

Note: LexiconHelper is not a utility for translators.
