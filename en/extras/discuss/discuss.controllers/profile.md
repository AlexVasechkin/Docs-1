The Profile controller acts as a legacy **redirect** coming from SMF. It does not have any options or templates, but just attempts to parse an SMF-style profile url to the proper Discuss style (user/index).

This controller has been marked as **deprecated** on 2012-12-18 with the goal of isolating legacy redirects someplace else in a future version.
