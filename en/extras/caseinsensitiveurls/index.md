## What is CaseInsensitiveURLs?

The CaseInsensitiveURLs Plugin redirects page requests for mixed-case URLs to the lowercase version when the mixed-case version is not found. URL query parameters will not be altered. The Plugin will not slow down your site because it only executes when the page-not-found event fires.

The Plugin is only useful if all of your Resource aliases are all lowercase.
