## What is StageCoach?

For new Resources in MODX, you can set a future publication date so that the new content won't appear until that date, but sometimes you want to stage changes to an existing Resource and not have the changes appear until a future date. That's exactly what StageCoach does for you.

StageCoach creates a "staged" version of the Resource that will replace the original at the specified date and time. All you need to do is set the date in the "Stage Date" TV.
