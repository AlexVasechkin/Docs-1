## Data-Entry

## How to input data

It's simple to add data with MIGX!

### Step 1: Setup

Make sure you've installed MIGX, set up a MIGX TV, applied it to a template, and created a resource with that template.

### Step 2: Data Entry

1. Go into your resource and then click the "Template Variables" tab. You should see your new TV. If you don't, go back to Step 1 and make sure your MIGX TV is set up correctly.
2. Click the "Add Item" button
3. Fill in the content as directed by the layout you created in the Backend Usage document
4. Click "Done"
5. Click "Save" to save your resource

### Step 3: Modifying Data

Right click on any item. Select either Update, Duplicate, or Remove.

### Step 4: Reordering Data

Click and drag items to change their ordering.

You're 3/4 done your MIGX experience. Ready for Step 4: [Frontend Usage](extras/migx/migx.frontend-usage "MIGX.Frontend-Usage")?
