## What is UpgradeMODX?

**Important: Always back up your site before upgrading.**

UpgradeMODX installs a dashboard widget that alerts you when there is an upgrade to MODX available -- and installs it for you!.

When there is an upgrade available, UpgradeMODX will show an "Upgrade MODX" button. Clicking on the button will show a form where you can select the version of MODX to install. Once you've selected a version, you can click on the "Install" button to launch Setup.

When Setup is finished, you'll be back in the Manager using a new version.

UpgradeMODX should work on any installation of MODX except the SDK version. That includes versions with renamed and/or moved directories.
