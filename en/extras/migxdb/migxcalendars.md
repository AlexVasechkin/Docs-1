## What is MigxCalendars?

MigxCalendars is a Date-Management-Extra for Revolution. It is using Adam Shaw's [fullcalendar](http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/) and migxAngular for viewing/editing any kind of events/dates.

This is the first public-beta for people, who want to play a bit around with it and to show what is possible with migxAngular.
