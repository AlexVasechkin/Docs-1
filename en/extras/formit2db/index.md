## <a name="notes"></a>Notes

1. The snippets bases on the code in the following thread in MODX forum <http://forums.modx.com/thread/?thread=32560>. Some parameter names have been changed to lowercase and some have been added.
2. If the xPDO package is autocreated, the classname in the package is generated by MODX and could be different to a classname set by parameter. If you disable the autoPackage parameter later, please look which classname was generated and change the parameter to that value.
3. Example for a JSON encoded array: &arrayFields = `\["formfield1","formfield2"\]`
