# mxFormBuilder

## Purpose:

 The goal with mxFormBuilder to to provide a consolidated and easy to user interface to manage all aspects for forms in your ModX site. Additional focus was to have built in protection for common security threats associated with forms.

## Getting Started:

### Installation

 The first thing you need to do is install the component if you have not already completed this. In the Manager for the site you want to install mxFormBuilder on from the top menu select "System" -> "Package Management". Once the Package Management page loads click on the "Download Extras" button. Now that we have the package browser panel loaded lets enter the search term "mxFormBuilder" in the search box on the left side of the window. Once you find the package listed as mxFormBuilder select "Download". When that completes you can now click on the the "Back to Package Management" button above the grid list. This will now allow us to select the "Install" button next to our local package list of mxFormBuilder.

### Properties

 | preHooks           | string (comma delimeted) |         | null    | Calls system snippets prior to form rendering. This allows you to modify form fields and options prior to the form rendering.
