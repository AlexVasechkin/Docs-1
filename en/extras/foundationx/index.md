## What is FoundationX? 

FoundationX is a MODX implementation of Zurb's responsive CSS framework, Foundation.

It allows users with little to no HTML or CSS knowledge to be able to quickly setup and customize a modern, responsive website within minutes by signing up for a MODX Cloud account and installing a FoundationX Snapshot.

See Live Demo here: <http://www.foundationx.net/>

## Requirements 

FoundationX is only available as a Snapshot in MODX Cloud. If you don't already have a MODX Cloud account, you can sign up for one [here](https://modxcloud.com/signup/?ref=foundationx).

## History 

FoundationX was created in 2012 by YJ Tso (@sepiariver) as a customizable "Super-Theme" for use in MODX Cloud.

## Installation 

In the MODX Cloud Dashboard, navigate to the "Marketplace" from the main menu. Select the FoundationX public Snapshot. Click on the "Inject Into Cloud" link. If you haven't created the Cloud in which you want to install FoundationX, you can follow the documentation [here](https://modxcloud.com/userguide/using-modx-cloud/clouds/create-cloud.html) to do so. In the "Inject into Cloud" pop-up window, select the Cloud you wish to overwrite, then click "Inject Into Cloud".

**The FoundationX Snapshot Will Overwrite Your Cloud**
Ensure that the Cloud you select to Inject the FoundationX Snapshot into doesn't contain data you wish to keep. If you're not sure, Backup the Cloud first. Learn how to Backup your Cloud [here](https://modxcloud.com/userguide/using-modx-cloud/backups/create-a-new-backup.html). All it takes is a mouse-click in MODX Cloud! 

When the Snapshot has been successfully injected, you'll receive a Notification. Navigate to that Cloud's Edit page, and on the list of options in the right sidebar, click on Create Admin User. Enter a username, password, and email address, and click "Create Admin User". When the process is complete, you'll get another Notification. You can then login to the MODX Manager using the credentials you just setup!
