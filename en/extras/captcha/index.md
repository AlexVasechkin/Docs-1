## What is Captcha?

This utility provides captcha verification in the MODX Manager login.
 It uses 5 system settings:

 captcha.enabled - If set, the captcha function is turned on

captcha.use\_mathstring - If set, the image is a simple equation for the user to solve

captcha.words - Selection of words used for the image if captcha.use\_mathstring is off

captcha.height - Height of captcha image in pixels

captcha.width - Width of captcha image in pixels

The Captcha components can also be used by other components to create captcha-style verification for front-end forms.

Install via Package Management, then modify the captcha System Settings as desired.
