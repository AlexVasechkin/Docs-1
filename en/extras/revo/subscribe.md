What is Subscribe?
------------------

Subscribe allows users to register as members on your site. It wraps the register snippet with a more extensive form that lets users unsubscribe, or (optionally) manage their preferences and group membership.

Subscribe works with both [Notify](https://bobsguides.com/notify-tutorial.html) and [EmailResource](https://bobsguides.com/emailresource-plugin-tutorial.html) to allow you to email selected groups of users on your site.

Features

- Built-in registration form
- Can be used with Notify and EmailResource to send emails to selected groups of users
- Users to email can be selected by both user groups and user preference/tags
- Double-opt-in registration with automatic confirm-register email to user
- Detailed tutorial
- User preferences/tags can be stored in the User Profile 'comment' field or in an extended Profile field
- Request-to-subscribe link to put in your template
- Popup "Why Subscribe" and "Privacy Policy" dialogs
- Internationalized

 Note: Unlike Mark Hamstra's SubscribeMe extra, Subscribe has no PayPal function.
