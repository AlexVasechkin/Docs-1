</div> What is Databackup? 
---------------------

 Databackup is a [Snippet](/revolution/2.x/developing-in-modx/basic-development/snippets "Snippets") for MODX Revolution that will backup your MODX MySQL database as one sql dump file and/or each table as a SQL dump as well as other MySQL databases. The extra does use PDO so it might be able to do other databases, like MSSQL, as is but I have not tested this.

 History 
---------

 Databackup was written by Josh Gulledge as an easy way to keep data backups, and first released on August 12th, 2011.

###  Download 

 It can be downloaded from within the MODx Revolution manager via [Package Management](/revolution/2.x/developing-in-modx/advanced-development/package-management "Package Management"), or from the MODx Extras Repository, here: <http://modx.com/extras/package/databackup>

###  Development and Bug Reporting 

 Databackup is stored and developed in GitHub, and can be found here:<https://github.com/jgulledge19/DataBackup>

 Bugs can be filed here: <https://github.com/jgulledge19/DataBackup/issues>

 How to Use 
------------

1. Install via the package manager
2. Set the databackup.folder setting to something that is above your web root. The default is core/components/databackup/dumps/
3. Set the purge time option (databackup.pruge) if you want this to be different, the default is 1814400, which is 21 days.
4. Set up Cron Manager: [display/ADDON/CronManager](/extras/revo/cronmanager) and then Create a new job.
5. Select the backup snippet and then select in minutes how often you would like this to run. Every 24 hours is 1440 minutes.

###  How to use snippet with getCache 

 See: [getcache](http://www.jasoncoward.com/technology/2010/10/simple-content-caching-with-getcache.html) for getCache examples.

 This is a simple backup your site every 24 hours(assuming the page is visited) or less if you flush the cache. It will also purge the backups older then 21 days.

```
<pre class="brush: php">[[!getCache?
&element=`backup`
&excludeTables=`my_custom_table,my_other_custom_table`
&cacheExpires=`86400`
]]

```###  [System Settings](/revolution/2.x/administering-your-site/settings/system-settings "System Settings")

 These need to be created if they do not exist.

 Be careful where you make the file path for the purge setting: databackup.folder. If you place this in an existing folder, all files older than the purge date will be delete. It is recommended that you create a new folder for your backups that is above your public WWW folder. </div>###  Available Properties 

 There is also a sample backupMany snippet. You can modify this example snippet to backup other databases.
