What is NewsPublisher?
----------------------

 NewsPublisher allows users to create and edit Resources in the front end, without having to log in to the MODX Manager. It allows editing of all resource fields (except the id field) and any Template Variables attached to the Resource. You choose which fields to display and can make most of them read-only if necessary. Full Rich Text editing is available for the content, description, and summary (introtext) fields and for any rich text TVs using TinyMCE 4. NewsPublisher provides built-in image and file browsing, as well as image editing via elFinder.

 3.0.x -- New Features -- No more extJS/modExt. No more dependence on the MODX TinyMCE extra. Uses the elFinder browser. Allows image editing (crop, rotate, resize) in browser. Loads TinyMCE 4 from tinymce.com. Automatically redirects to Login page for not-logged-in users. See changelog for full list.

 NewsPublisher presents a modifiable form for creating new resources and editing existing resources in the front end of a web site. The NpEditThisButton snippet is also included, which displays a button to launch NewsPublisher for the current page.

 NewsPublisher responds to the MODX security permissions for a page. Users without the appropriate permissions cannot create or edit pages they are not authorized to access.

 You can now have multiple edit buttons on a single page and can place edit buttons in the Tpl chunk of getResources or any other aggregator snippet.
