What is EmailResource?
----------------------

EMails an HTML version of any resource with inline CSS code based on your CSS in files, resources, or chunks. The plugin is attached to the OnWebPagePrerender System Event and acts when the resource is previewed from the Manager.

Bulk emailing of the resource is now supported, as is tag-based sending, which can be used in conjunction with the Subscribe package.

This extra would not exist without the generous support of [WorkDay Media](http://workdaymedia.com.au)
