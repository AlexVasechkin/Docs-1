What is ClassExtender?
----------------------

ClassExtender is designed to make it easy to extend the modUser and modResource objects in MODX. It will not only extend the objects for you, it also gives you tools update them in the database, and search for your extended objects and display them.

Plugins are provided that, with modification, will display your extra fields on the Create/Edit User and Resource pages and will save the data to your custom table when those forms are submitted.
