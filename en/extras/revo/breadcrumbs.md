<table><tbody><tr><th>Name</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Default</th> </tr><tr><td>crumbSeparator</td> <td>Define what you want between the crumbs.</td> <td>Â»</td> </tr><tr><td>currentAsLink</td> <td>If you want the current page crumb to be a link (to itself) "1" for true, "0" for false (without quotes)</td> <td>1  
</td> </tr><tr><td>descField</td> <td>To change default page field to be used as a breadcrumb description, default is description. Falls back to pagetitle if description is empty.</td> <td>description</td> </tr><tr><td>homeCrumbDescription</td> <td>In case you want to have a custom description of the home link. Defaults to title of home link.</td> <td>Home</td> </tr><tr><td>homeCrumbTitle</td> <td>Just in case you want to have a home link, but want to call it something else.</td> <td>Home</td> </tr><tr><td>maxCrumbs</td> <td>Max number of elements to have in a path. 100 is an arbitrary high number. If you make it smaller, like say 2, but you are 5 levels deep, it will appear as: Home > ... > Level 4 > Level 5 It should be noted that "Home" and the current page do not count. Each of these are configured separately.</td> <td>100</td> </tr><tr><td>maxDelimiter</td> <td>The string that will show if the maximum number of breadcrumbs has been shown.</td> <td>...</td> </tr><tr><td>pathThruUnPub</td> <td>When your path includes an unpublished folder, setting this to true will show all resources in path EXCEPT the unpublished. Example path (unpublished in caps): home > news > CURRENT > SPORTS > skiiing > article $pathThruUnPub = true would give you this: home > news > skiiing > article $pathThruUnPub = false would give you this: home > skiiing > article (assuming you have home crumb turned on)</td> <td>1  
</td> </tr><tr><td>respectHidemenu</td> <td>If true, will hide items in the breadcrumbs that are set to be hidden in menus.</td> <td>1  
</td> </tr><tr><td>showCrumbsAtHome</td> <td>You can use this to toggle the breadcrumbs on the home page.</td> <td>0</td> </tr><tr><td>showCurrentCrumb</td> <td>Show the current page in path.</td> <td>1</td> </tr><tr><td>showHomeCrumb</td> <td>Would you like your crumb string to start with a link to home? Some would not because a home link is usually found in the site logo or elsewhere in the navigation scheme.</td> <td>1</td> </tr><tr><td>titleField</td> <td>To change default page field to be used as a breadcrumb title. Defaults to pagetitle.</td> <td>pagetitle</td></tr></tbody></table>### Breadcrumbs Classes

<table><tbody><tr><th>Classname</th> <th>Description</th> </tr><tr><td>B\_crumbBox</td> <td>Span that surrounds all crumb output</td> </tr><tr><td>B\_hideCrumb</td> <td>Span surrounding the "..." if there are more crumbs than will be shown</td> </tr><tr><td>B\_currentCrumb</td> <td>Span or A tag surrounding the current crumb</td> </tr><tr><td>B\_firstCrumb</td> <td>Span that always surrounds the first crumb, whether it is "home" or not</td> </tr><tr><td>B\_lastCrumb</td> <td>Span surrounding last crumb, whether it is the current page or not .</td> </tr><tr><td>B\_crumb</td> <td>Class given to each A tag surrounding the intermediate crumbs (not home, or hide)</td> </tr><tr><td>B\_homeCrumb</td> <td>Class given to the home crumb</td></tr></tbody></table>Examples

```In MODX Revolution 2.2, the &respectHidemenu property value must be given as `0` or `1` rather than `true` or `false`. I haven't tested this in other versions, but the 2.2 site I'm working on now would not adhere to the property's settings using `true` or `false`.
