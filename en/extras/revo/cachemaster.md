What is CacheMaster?
--------------------

On a large site, MODX's default behavior of clearing the cache for all Resources whenever you save a Resource or Element can really slow things down for your visitors. The CacheMaster Plugin for MODX Revolution allows you to have the cache cleared for a single Resource or Element when you save it, without clearing anything else.

It will also, optionally, uncheck the "Empty Cache" checkbox by default when you edit a Resource or Element.
