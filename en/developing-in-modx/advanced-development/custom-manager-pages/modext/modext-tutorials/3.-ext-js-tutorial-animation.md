## Animations

Once again, we include the required JS and CSS:

```
<pre class="brush: php">
<link  rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="manager/assets/ext3/resources/css/ext-all.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="manager/assets/ext3/adapter/ext/ext-base.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="manager/assets/ext3/ext-all.js"></script>

```And then we add some controls that will perform a simple animation that will resize a div:

```
<pre class="brush: php">
    <script type="text/javascript">        
        Ext.onReady(function() {
            var myDiv1 = Ext.get('div1');
            myDiv1.setSize(350,350, {duration: 1, easing:'bounceOut'});
        });        
    </script>

```To get the div ready and make our animation easier to see, we need to provide some styling:

```
<pre class="brush: php">
    <style type="text/css">
        .myDiv {
            border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;
            background: yellow;
            width: 200px;
            height: 35px;
        }
    </style>

```Finally, actually create the div down in your HTML body:

```
<pre class="brush: php">
<div id="div1" class="myDiv"></div>

```When your finished, this page should look something like this:

```
<pre class="brush: php">
<html>
    <title>My Ext JS Test Page : Animations</title>
    <link  rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="manager/assets/ext3/resources/css/ext-all.css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="manager/assets/ext3/adapter/ext/ext-base.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="manager/assets/ext3/ext-all.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        
        Ext.onReady(function() {
            var myDiv1 = Ext.get('div1');
            myDiv1.setHeight(200);
            myDiv1.setSize(350,350, {duration: 1, easing:'bounceOut'});
        });        
    </script>
    
    <style type="text/css">
        .myDiv {
            border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;
            background: yellow;
            width: 200px;
            height: 35px;
        }
    </style>
    <body>
        <h1>Animations</h1>

        <div id="div1" class="myDiv"></div>    
       
    </body>
</html>

```When you view this in a browser, you should see your div grow in size to become a square.

### Other Commands

You can also use the **setHeight** or **setWidth** methods, e.g.:

```
<pre class="brush: php">
 
myDiv1.setHeight(200);

```### Easing

One of the keys to this trick is the "easing" property. The available easing options depend on which library is loaded, but here is a short list of easing options that are available

Easing TypeDescription**easeNone**Uniform speed between points.**easeIn**Begins slowly and accelerates towards end. (quadratic)**easeOut**Begins quickly and decelerates towards end. (quadratic)**easeBoth**Begins slowly and decelerates towards end. (quadratic)**easeInStrong**Begins slowly and accelerates towards end. (quartic)**easeOutStrong**Begins quickly and decelerates towards end. (quartic)**easeBothStrong**Begins slowly and decelerates towards end. (quartic)**elasticIn**Snap in elastic effect.**elasticOut**Snap out elastic effect.**elasticBoth**Snap both elastic effect.**backIn**Backtracks slightly, then reverses direction and moves to end.**backOut**Overshoots end, then reverses and comes back to end.**backBoth**Backtracks slightly, then reverses direction, overshoots end, then reverses and comes back to end.**bounceIn**Bounce off of start.**bounceOut**Bounces off end.**bounceBoth**Bounces off start and end.1.
