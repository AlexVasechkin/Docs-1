<div class="note">Media Sources are only available in MODX Revolution 2.2 or later.</div>What are Media Sources?
-----------------------

Media Sources are a feature in MODX Revolution, where one can specify the "source" of media in their MODX installation. This is visualized in many ways - the most common being in the left-hand Files tree, the MODx.Browser window, and file and image TVs.

A source can be many types - from the file system itself, to an Amazon S3 bucket, to a Flickr album. MODX provides two source types with the core installation: the file system and Amazon S3 bucket integration. Other sources can be made by creating Media Source Drivers, or by downloading them from [Package Management](/revolution/2.x/developing-in-modx/advanced-development/package-management "Package Management").
