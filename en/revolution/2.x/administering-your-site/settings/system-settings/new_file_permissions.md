**Name**: New File Permissions   
**Type**: string   
**Default**: 0644

When uploading a new file in the File Manager, the File Manager will attempt to change the file permissions to those entered in this setting. This may not work on some setups, such as IIS, in which case you will need to manually change the permissions.
