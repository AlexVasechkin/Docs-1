After following the [tutorial](tutorial.md), it's time to start thinking about how to build your interface.

You can use [ExtJS/modEXT](modext), but that's not required. 

It's also possible to use the Parsed Manager Controller to use your standard MODX tags to populate a CMP. [Learn more in the MODX Cookbook](https://modxcookbook.com/customize-manager/cmps/cmp-made-easy.html)
