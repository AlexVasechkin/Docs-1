The xPDO class itself serves many purposes, all of which aim to provide a core set of features to make implementing an object model quick and painless, and to do so without limiting how you implement it. Let's take a look at the three main roles an instance of xPDO serves, and then we'll look at different ways to use it.

Since xPDO as a framework is primarily a tool for working with relational data, it makes sense that the first role we'll explore is that of a wrapper class for PDO.

1. [As PDO Wrapper](/xpdo/2.x/getting-started/fundamentals/xpdo,-the-class/as-pdo-wrapper)
2. [As Service Layer](/xpdo/2.x/getting-started/fundamentals/xpdo,-the-class/as-service-layer)
3. [As Object and Relational Mapper](/xpdo/2.x/getting-started/fundamentals/xpdo,-the-class/as-object-and-relational-mapper)
4. [The xPDO Constructor](/xpdo/2.x/getting-started/fundamentals/xpdo,-the-class/the-xpdo-constructor)
