There are a number of important design patterns that inspired the development of xPDO. These patterns are well described and are a part of Martin Fowler's _Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (P of EAA)_. These include, but are certainly not limited to the following:

- Domain Model
- Active Record
- Data Mapper
- Lazy Load
- Identity Field
- Single Table Inheritance
- Metadata Mapping
- Query Object

It would be a good idea to at least become familiar with these patterns (and the others in the catalog) before jumping into coding with xPDO; understanding these concepts will help everything else fall into place as you begin learning more about xPDO.
