Want to help write the documentation? Please do!

The [documentation files are hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/modxorg/Docs), allowing anyone to propose changes. The documentation sources are written in Markdown. 

If you're new to git or GitHub, the following screencast will show you how you can edit the documentation with just the browser.
