## What is a Resource Group?

A Resource Group is a collection of Resources, e.g. "Members Only" pages. When coupled with User Groups, Resource Groups are used to restrict access to pages and resources. A MODX page can belong to multiple resource groups.

## Usage

You can manage the pages in a Resource Group in two different ways:

### Option 1

Go to Security -> Resource Groups. From there you will see a list of all defined Resource Groups and a tree of Resources.

Drag the Resources from the right tree directly into Resource Groups in the left tree:

### Option 2

When you are editing a Resource directly, click on its "Access Permissions" tab, and check which Resource Groups it is a member of.
