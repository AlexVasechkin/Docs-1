The Snippet Dashboard Widget Type runs a MODX Snippet and places the return value in the widget panel.

## Usage

Simply place the name of the Snippet (no tags) you would like to run in the content of the widget, ie:

``` php
MyCustomDashboardSnippet
```

The output returned by the Snippet will be displayed in the dashboard widget.
