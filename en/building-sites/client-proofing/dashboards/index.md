Dashboards are only available in MODX 2.2 or later.

## What are Dashboards?

A Dashboard in MODX is the page that shows on initial loading of the MODX manager, or when clicking the "Dashboard" link in the top-left of the screen. Dashboards can contain an unlimited number of "widgets", which are boxes that show various content on the Dashboard. Widgets can be arranged in any order, and can be either a file, a MODX Snippet, or straight HTML.

Each User Group in MODX is assigned a Dashboard by default. This means that you can give different Users different Dashboards via the User Group they belong to.

If a User is part of two different groups, it will use the Dashboard of its Primary Group, which can be set in the User editing screen.
