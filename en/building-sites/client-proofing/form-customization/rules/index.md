## What is a Rule?

Rules in MODX Revolution are simply generic rules that apply to any Action (manager page). They also can be tied to User Groups, wherein a Rule will only be applied if the User is part of that User Group.

## What are the Rules available?

The available Rules are:

``` php
[[getResources@section? &parents=`133` &context=`revolution`]]
```
