Plugins are PHP code that fire when _Events_ are fired. The MODX core has lots of events that fire at different points during the parsing and interacting with objects in the manager.

When building sites, you'll usually only use existing plugins that are available as installable packages, but if you're confident in PHP you can also write your own.
