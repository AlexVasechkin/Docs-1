## compress\_js

**Name**: Use Compressed Javascript Libraries
**Type**: Yes/No
**Default**: Yes

When this is enabled, MODx will use a compressed version of its custom JavaScript libraries. This greatly reduces load and execution time. Disable only if you are modifying core elements.

This setting will not work in Git deployments of Revolution. Leave at 'No'.
