## context\_tree\_sortby

 **Name**: Sort Field of Contexts in Resource Tree
**Type**: Textfield
**Default**: rank
**Available In:** 2.1.2+

 The sort field for contexts in the resource tree when loading the manager. The values "key" or "rank" make sense here. When you specify "key" the contexts will be sorted by their name. If "rank" is specified the contexts will be sorted by the internal rank (works like menuindex for resources) which you can change by dragging and dropping contexts into order.
