## archive\_with

**Name**: Force PCLZip Archives 
**Type**: Yes/No 
**Default**: Yes 
**Available In**: Revolution 2.0.7+

If true, will use PCLZip instead of ZipArchive as the zip extension. Turn this on if you are getting extractTo errors or are having problems with unzipping in [Package Management](developing-in-modx/advanced-development/package-management "Package Management").
