## udperms\_allowroot

**Name**: Allow Root Resource Creation 
**Type**: Yes/No 
**Default**: No

If true, allows users to create new resources in the root of the site.

This setting is **deprecated** in MODx Revolution. It has been replaced by the 'new\_document\_in\_root' [Permission](administering-your-site/security/policies/permissions "Permissions") in the Administrator Policy (the permission is granted by default).
