## use\_browser

**Name**: Use File Browser
**Type**: Yes/No
**Default**: Yes

If set to Yes, enables the resource browser. This will allow your users to browse and upload resources such as images, flash and media files on the server.

This setting is **deprecated** in MODX Revolution. Use the file\_tree and file\_manager [Permissions](building-sites/client-proofing/security/policies/permissions "Permissions") instead.
