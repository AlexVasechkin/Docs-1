## rb\_base\_url

**Name**: Resource Browser Base URL
**Type**: String
**Default**:

Enter the virtual path to resource directory. This setting is usually automatically generated. If you're using IIS, however, MODX may not be able to work the URL out on it's own, causing the Resource Browser to show an error. In that case, you can enter the URL to the images directory here (the URL as you'd enter it on Internet Explorer).

This setting is **deprecated** in MODX Revolution. Please use [filemanager\_path](building-sites/settings/filemanager_path "filemanager_path") instead.
