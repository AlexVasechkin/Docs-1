## session\_name

**Name**: Session Name
**Type**: String
**Default**: modxcmssession

Use this setting to customize the session name used for the sessions in MODX.

This setting isn't set by default in MODX, as it's best to let PHP calculate this on its own. Only set this if you know what you are doing.
