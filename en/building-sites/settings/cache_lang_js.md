## cache\_lang\_js

**Name**: Cache Lexicon JS Strings
**Type**: Yes/No
**Default**: Yes
**Available In**: Revolution 2.0.6+

If set to true, this will use server headers to cache the lexicon strings loaded into JavaScript for the manager interface.

There's really no reason to turn this off, unless you like a slower mgr interface.
