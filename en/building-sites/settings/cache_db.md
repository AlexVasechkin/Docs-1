## cache\_db

**Name**: Enable Database Cache
**Type**: Yes/No
**Default**: No

When enabled, objects and raw result sets from SQL queries are cached to significantly reduce database loads.

This can take up a good amount of hard drive space. Only do this if you have enough space to scale the requests.
